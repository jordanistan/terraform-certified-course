Hello, and welcome to this lesson on the Terraform workflow.
My name is Moosa Khalid,
your course author and training architect for this course.
When thinking of the Terraform workflow,
there's only really two things in there. First, you write the code.
Then you review the changes that the code will make.
And finally you execute or deploy the actual code to realize real
infrastructure, wherever you might want to deploy it.
In the write phase,
you're generally starting off either with a version control system as a best
practice or even a flat file if you're working individually.
Version control is recommended as a best practice so that you and a team can
collaborate and enter it over the issues within your code.
We then move on to planning or reviewing the changes that your code will make.
This is an important step in the Terraform workflow,
because at this point you're not yet deploying any infrastructure,
but you can go ahead and see in detail the changes that the code will make
within your actual environment.
And looking at the review of the changes that the code will make,
you can go back and modify your code. And with this cycle,
you can perfect your code and get it to work exactly as you need it to.
Finally,
you move on to deploying or executing the code and making actual changes to an
environment. This step deploys actual infrastructure,
and creates real resources in the cloud.
Whether you're working as an individual or a team,
this workflow will yield the best results and the best efficiency.
Later in the course,
we'll be going through a lab and also a lesson which maps actual Terraform
commands to the workflow. Thank you for going through this lesson.
